# Overview

This repository contains data and scripts for analyzing IC-123. 

Any data accompanying this project can be stored in the `data/` directory, while any scripts used to process the data can be stored in the `scripts/` directory.

> [!NOTE]  
> _**By default**, any data or files added to the `data/` directory are ignored by git due to our `.gitignore`, so you can store large files or data here without worrying about them being uploaded to Github._ If you would to upload a small data file (<5MB) to Github, you can stage the file using force, `-f`, option to the `git add`:  
> ```bash
> # Stage file for commit
> git add -f data/counts.tsv
> # Commit the file to history
> git commit -m "Adding small counts matrix"
> ```

Please add some more information about the project here. This can be copied directly from the project description. Also please update any references to IC-123 to the correct project identifer. For example: NCBR-123, NHLBI-123, NIAMS-123, etc. 

The easiest way to do this is with sed or find/replace in your text editor. Please feel free to also delete or keep any in this file. This is just a template to get you started, and you can modify it as needed. At the end of the day, this is your project and you can structure it however you like!

```bash
# On biowulf/helix,
# Example sed commnad on linux,
# this can be run on Biowulf
sed -i 's/IC-123/NCBR-123/g' README.md

# On local laptop,
# Example sed on macOSX,
# this can be run on your local machine
sed -i '' 's/IC-123/NCBR-123/g' README.md
